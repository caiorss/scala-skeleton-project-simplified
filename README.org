* Sample Scala Project with Simplified Structure 
** What is it

This program is Java Swing Window and an embedded Groovy console where
the user can run scripts and manipulate the window interactively. 

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate how to create a sample
scala project with simplified structure not following Maven
boilerplate layout and making the assumptions that it is Scala-only,
that there is no java source code and there is only one base package,
aka namespace, which is omited.

In a standard Scala project the directory layout of the project would
be like as shown in the schema below with lost of nested directories
and the sub directories /com/org/apptest for the package com.org.apptest: 

#+BEGIN_SRC text 
src/
  main/
   scala/
     com/org/apptest/
                Main.scala 
                UserInterface.scala 

   java/        
#+END_SRC

This project simplifies the directory structure to: 

#+BEGIN_SRC text 
src/
   Main.scala 
   UserInterface.scala 
#+END_SRC

This was tested sucessfully with jetBrains's InteliJ Idea and Scala's
sbt tool. 

** Build, Running and Deploying 

To build the project go to its root directory and run: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
$ sbt run
[info] Loading settings from idea.sbt,plugins.sbt ...
[info] Loading global plugins from /home/archbox/.sbt/1.0/plugins

[info] Set current project to myApplication (in build file:/home/archbox/workspace2/sample-project2/)
[info] Running com.org.apptest.Main 
Initializing groovy Console

#+END_SRC

To create a standalone program, uber jar with all dependencies bundled
run: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ sbt assembly

To create the uber jar and copy it to the project's root directory
run:

#+END_SRC


The created uber jar, namely myApplication-uber.jar can be run by just
double clicking on it or running the command: 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh 
  $ java -jar myApplication-uber.jar 
  Initializing groovy Console
  i = 1
  i = 2
